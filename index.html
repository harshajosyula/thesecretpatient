Want to know about characters?
“THE SILENT PATIENT” is a psychological thriller mainly based on 4
characters. Theo Faber, Kathy Faber, Alicia Brenson, and Gabriel Berenson.
Alicia berenson :
She is a shy person who always tries to keep her problems to herself and the
victim of her past. Her only love is for her husband and for her paintings.
Theo Faber:
Same as Alicia, Theo is also a victim of his father’s state of vexation, abused, and
traumatized.
Kathy Faber:
She is a young woman who is purely in love with Theo. By the time passes she
loses her interest in Theo and shifts her interest to an unknown man and this
makes him feel agitated.
Gabriel berenson:
Gabriel is the love of Alicia‘s life in this book. He plays the role of a gentleman

and he takes good care of his wife and makes her feel comfortable around him
which makes her think he is a gentleman.
Let’s get down to the storyline :
As we speak about the main characters Theo and Alicia both were traumatized by
their parents(grew up in separate families). Both moved away from their parents in
order to enjoy their freedom. After they move out, Theo seeks help from a therapist
to recover from his trauma and pursue his studies and Alicia ends up being an
impeccable painter. She marries Gabriel Berenson, the only love of her life, and
leads a comfortable life. But suddenly Gabriel Berenson is killed brutally in his
house and police think Alicia killed him. Did she really kill her husband? Her
trauma was created by her father and by her husband’s death, will it be cured or
will it not be.....?. How will Theo Faber help her? Can he make her talk and know
what happened that night?
Why did we read this book?
We searched for thriller books as our team is more into the thriller genre. “The
silent patient” book is a 2019 Newyork Times bestseller. As the book is a
psychological thriller, we got to experience some heartbroken feelings in the story
and the way that doctors of psychology treat their patients. We assure you that the
book makes you visualize every scene that’s going on in it.
The book storylines make us glued to it. We felt spirits rising up in us while going
through the book, the first parts are as important as the climax since they slowly
connect to the ending. Although the pace of the story is slow, we need patience
because the deeper we go, the more stimulating it will be
How is the writing
style?
The writing style of the book is so good that we sensed the plot of the book went
on like a movie. Though it had some cons in it, we felt much obliged to read this

book. We perceive that it is obvious to have such feelings for the book because the
author is a screenwriter. The way the story has culminated should be much
appreciated of course the word appreciate is undervalued for his work
What did I like:

➢ Narration and plot are more interesting and minds gripping.
➢ Characters and their roles are clearly justified in the end.
➢ Twist plot and ending are unbelievable.
➢ The connection among the characters and the story gradually
raises
➢ Characters can be related to the outside world.
➢ Few scenes on psychology aspects tell you that the Author did
his homework regarding psychology
What I did not like:
➢ Though the ending is mindblowing, we thought it could
be made better and clearer regarding Theo Faber's future.
➢ We feel Kathy Faber’s character is somewhat neglected
going deeper into the story.
➢ Vocabulary is very high in this book at first but gradually we
will get hold of it.
Closing Bells !!!:
In the end, we want to tell you that the “THE SILENT

PATIENT” book is worth reading. The genre of the book is “THRILLER”
with a touch of psychology. If you are a fan of drama including twists then
this is for you!!!!!! Just go for it.

THANK YOU
